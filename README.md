💻 Installation Guide & Tips

Installation Guide:

1. Install Prism Launcher (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, It's faster, better, and has a ton of QoL features)
2. In Prism Launcher, click Add Instance ➞ Modrinth ➞ Type "ALAND" in the Search ➞ Click the Modpack ➞ Click OK

TIP 1: For Prism users, make sure you select the correct Java version and dedicate at least 4GB of RAM.

TIP 2: Type /firmament macros to open the command macros/keybinds. These run commands for Hypixel SkyBlock such as warps and menus.

TIP 3: Tap Right Ctrl to open the weather and time control menu, and tap Right Shift to open the emote wheel.

TIP 4: If you use the Hypixel+ resource pack, then put this inside the JVM arguments field: -Xss4M

TIP 5: Don't like a certain mod/feature/resource pack? Just delete/configure it however you like!
