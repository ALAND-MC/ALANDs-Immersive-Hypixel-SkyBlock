💻 Installation Guide & Tips

Installation Guide:

1. Install Prism Launcher (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, It's faster, better, and has a ton of QoL features)
2. In Prism Launcher, click Add Instance ➞ Modrinth ➞ Type "ALAND" in the Search ➞ Click the Modpack ➞ Click OK

TIP 1: For Prism users, make sure you select the correct Java version and dedicate at least 4GB of RAM.

TIP 2: Type /firmament macros or tap the "Delete" key on your keyboard to open the command macros/keybinds. These run commands for Hypixel SkyBlock such as warps and menus.

TIP 3: Go to Control Settings to figure out how to open other menus like the weather control and emote wheel.

TIP 4: If you use the Hypixel+ resource pack, then put this inside the JVM arguments field: -Xss4M

TIP 5: Don't like a certain mod/feature/resource pack? Just delete/configure it however you like!

❓ FAQ

Why did the modpack crash/fail to load?

* Make sure you select the correct Java version and dedicate at least 4GB of RAM. Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP1gQ-rnixM

Why is my FPS stuck at 60?

* VSync is turned on to prevent screen tear artefacts and reduce resource usage, ensuring a smooth experience. You can disable it in the general Video Settings and by configuring the Dynamic FPS mod to turn it off everywhere.

I'm having FPS issues! How to fix?

* If you play on a potato, try disabling some/all resource packs, deleting the Roughly Enough Items and REI Search Bar Calculations mod, and further lowering your graphical settings. P.S. Lag during game startup is to be expected, just give it a minute or two to load everything.

How do I get animated eyes?

* Disable the Detailed Animations resource pack and enable the Detailed Animations x Just Expressions one, and then follow this guide. Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S483mATaL2c

Why do some player/NPC skins have broken faces?

* If you're using Detailed Animations x Just Expressions like mentioned above, some skins with extra pixels in their texture will inevitably break because of the way Hypixel made them. To fix this, press ESC ➞ Mods ➞ Search for Entity Model Features and open config ➞ Models ➞ Player Settings ➞ Turn on "Only modify your player model and back out of the menu to save. This will disable player animations for all other players which isn't the best, but it's there if you want.

How do I emote?

* Tap the "Left Alt" key to open the emote wheel. To change this keybind, go to Settings ➞ Controls ➞ Keybinds ➞ Find the keybind for Emotecraft's emote wheel.

Why is there no fog?

* It's disabled due to a glitch which turns it pitch-black when entering the Matriarch. If you still want it, go to Resource Packs ➞ Click the config button over Visual Effects+ ➞ Set "Biome Fog" to "True" ➞ Close the menu.

How do I inspect or spin/do tricks with my weapon?

* On 1.21.5, hold down the scroll wheen or MMB button. On 1.21.8, hold the "G" key.

How do I change time/weather?

* Tap the "Right Control" key. If you can't find it, go to Settings ➞ Controls ➞ Keybinds ➞ Find the keybind for LocalTime or Client Time to open the time and gui menu.

I don't use Prism Launcher, how do I load the modpack?

* Install Prism Launcher, it's lightweight, super fast, and allows you to download mods/resource packs with ease. It's the best option for modern Minecraft.

Can I transfer my own config files for x mod?

* Yes, you can just delete the config file of any mod in the modpack's "config" folder and replace it with your own. This way, you can transfer your own SkyHanni/Skyblocker/other settings over.

Why did I randomly warp/trigger a command by tapping a random key?

* These are known as command macros/keybinds. Type /firmament macros or tap the "Delete" key to open the config menu. You can assign any key and make it run any command you want to make warping/accessing menus easier!
